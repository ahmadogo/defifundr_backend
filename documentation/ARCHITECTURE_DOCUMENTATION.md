## System Components

### 1. **Frontend (Mobile & Web)**
   - **Technologies**: React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Dart.
   - **Description**:
     - The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the DefiFundr system.
     - Users can create campaigns, manage payrolls, and view invoices.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Responsive design for mobile and web.
     - Integration with backend APIs and blockchain.

### 2. **Backend (API Server)**
   - **Technologies**: Go (Golang), Node.js, Express.js.
   - **Description**:
     - The backend handles business logic, data processing, and communication with the blockchain.
     - It exposes RESTful APIs for the frontend to interact with.
   - **Key Features**:
     - User authentication and authorization.
     - Campaign management (creation, donation, withdrawal).
     - Integration with Ethereum blockchain.

### 3. **Blockchain (Smart Contracts)**
   - **Technologies**: Cairo.
   - **Description**:
     - Smart contracts handle decentralized logic for payroll and invoice management.
     - They ensure transparency, security, and immutability of transactions.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Campaign creation and funding.
     - Fund disbursement upon successful campaigns.
     - Refund mechanism for unsuccessful campaigns.

### 4. **Database**
   - **Technologies**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
   - **Description**:
     - The database stores user data, campaign details, and transaction history.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Relational database for structured data (PostgreSQL).
     - NoSQL database for flexible data storage (MongoDB).

### 5. **Authentication Service**
   - **Technologies**: OAuth 2.0, JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
   - **Description**:
     - Handles user authentication and authorization.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Secure login and session management.
     - Integration with third-party authentication providers (e.g., Google, MetaMask).

### 6. **Storage (IPFS)**
   - **Technologies**: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System).
   - **Description**:
     - Stores large files (e.g., campaign images, documents) in a decentralized manner.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Decentralized and distributed file storage.
     - Immutable file references.

---

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**:
   - Users interact with the frontend (mobile or web) to create campaigns, donate, or manage payrolls.

2. **API Requests**:
   - The frontend sends API requests to the backend for processing.

3. **Business Logic**:
   - The backend processes the requests, interacts with the database, and communicates with the blockchain.

4. **Blockchain Interaction**:
   - The backend sends transactions to the Ethereum blockchain via smart contracts.

5. **Data Storage**:
   - User data and campaign details are stored in the database.
   - Large files are stored on IPFS.

6. **Response**:
   - The backend sends a response back to the frontend, which updates the UI accordingly.

  - **Web3.js/Ethers.js**: Libraries for interacting with the blockchain.

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**:
   - Use OAuth 2.0 and JWT for secure user authentication.
   - Integrate MetaMask for blockchain-based authentication.

2. **Data Encryption**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., user credentials) in transit and at rest.

3. **Smart Contract Security**:
   - Perform thorough testing and auditing of smart contracts.
   - Use tools like Slither or MythX for vulnerability detection.

4. **Access Control**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for backend APIs.

---

## Deployment Architecture

### 1. **Frontend**:
   - Hosted on platforms like Vercel (Web) or Firebase (Mobile).

### 2. **Backend**:
   - Deployed on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.

### 3. **Blockchain**:
   - Smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum mainnet or testnet.

### 4. **Database**:
   - Managed databases like AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) or MongoDB Atlas.

### 5. **Storage**:
